This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities within financial transaction data from PaisaBazaar. Leveraging machine learning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the notebook provides insights into customer behavior and helps identify patterns commonly associated with fraud.

*** Project Objectives:

1. Analyze and understand transaction patterns.

2. Preprocess and clean raw data.

3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

4. Build a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions.

5. Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.


*** Key Features:

Data Cleaning: Removal of null values, irrelevant columns, and handling of categorical data.

EDA: Visualizations and statistical summaries to discover fraud patterns.

Feature Engineering: Derived features to improve model prediction capability.

Modeling: Applied logistic regression and other machine learning classifiers.

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix used for evaluation.


*** Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, etc.)
